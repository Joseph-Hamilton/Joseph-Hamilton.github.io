    <p>In 1790, Bretagne, France, talented young painter Marianne (Noémie Merlant played) received a commision, that she needed finished a portrait of a rich miss Héloïse (Adèle Haenel played) before her marriage without her knowledge. The two people lived with each other in an isolated island. During the day the femail painter quietly observed the lady's every single move and induged in brush in the middle of the night. In close contact with painting and being painted, the two gradually sprouted taboo ambiguous feelings even in an era full of ritual constraints. As the wedding day drawed closer, their love fire was burning hotter. </p>
